# BBCC (Bring Back Couch CO-OP) Controller

A mobile/desktop game controller application compatible with the BBCC multiplayer server.  The application is built with Flutter, 
and uses websockets to communicate with the server.  My team used BBCC to add multiplayer functionality to our game project for our
Interactice Systems class at tOSU.

The server code can be found at https://github.com/ethandpowers/BBCC-Server
